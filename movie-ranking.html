<h1>The best three movies according to Sanyam(ie ME)</h1>
<h2> My top three movies of all time are:</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Violet Evergarden movie</h3>
<p>The BEST anime movie(according to me). The visuals,plot,characters(especially VIOLET!!).I love everything about this movie.</p>
<h3>Your name</h3>
<p>The visuals,soundtrack and the fan favourite trope of both the mcs getting separated and the  reconciled. This movie is everything and contains everthing a novice would love about his first anime movie.</p>
<h3>I want to eat your pancreas!</h3>
<p> The classic trope of unwanted death of a main character but this time it is fulfilled to perfection.  rollercoaster of joy,sorrow and much more.</p>
